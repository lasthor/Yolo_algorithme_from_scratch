# Introduction
The YOLOv1 algorithm revolutionized object detection by introducing a single-stage approach, where object localization and classification are performed simultaneously. This implementation is based on the original paper by Joseph Redmon et al. and aims to provide a straightforward implementation for easy understanding and usage.

# Installation
To get started with this implementation, follow these steps:

### Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/lasthor/Yolo_algorithme_from_scratch.git

### Install the required dependencies. You can use pip to install them:
pip install -r requirements.txt


# Usage

To train the YOLOv1 algorithm manually, please follow these steps:

1- Open the train.py file in your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

2- Locate the section of code where the training process is implemented. This section typically includes a loop over the dataset and training steps.

3- Modify the training process as per your requirements. You can customize various aspects of the training, such as hyperparameters, optimization algorithms, and more.
